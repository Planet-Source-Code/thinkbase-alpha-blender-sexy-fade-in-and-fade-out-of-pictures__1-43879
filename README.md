### Description

Hello Everybody!..

This is an Alpa Blender project.. That is : it uses two image files(which u give ofcourse;).. And it fades them in and out in the SIMPLEST possible way.. It is faster too;--) You can specify the program the interval(time) to take to fade in and out.. It uses only one main API to do so called : "AlphaBlend". And it is Flicker-free too. The code is FULLY Commented! Enjoy!.. I would appreciate your votes and comments,! :)

Update : Now I have added a slider control too on the form, So that you can see the Fastest Blending speed of this program in action. This is the Fastest Blending program i have ever seen on net;) No matter how bigger are your blending images, it would not effect the blending speed :) Please vote
